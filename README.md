# CP1404 Practicals

## Practical work for IT@JCU CP1404

## About me:

I am Diana Bukeikhanova, a student of Bachelor (Majoring in IT) at James Cook University.
Right now, I am studying in Singapore, but my home country is Kazakhstan.

## About CP1404 repository:

This repository represents all my practicals from CP1404: Programming II (subject).
It shows my learning, education, improvement processes in good usage of Python, GitHub, Kivy.

## 3 Main lessons that I learned about "clean code":

- DO NOT repeat yourself and be careful. (Try to avoid self-repetition and repetition of the same structures in the
  code)
- Follow SRP rules. (SRP is a computer programming principle that states that one function has one task to do)
- Follow Naming Convention in coding. (Naming Convention is a set of rules for giving names in coding.)
